    "1- In Part 1A, the state variables I used were height, mid, row, leading_spaces, inner_spaces, and line. In Part 1B, the state variables I used were height, mid, row, dist, leading_spaces, inner_spaces, and line. In Part 2, the state variables I used were text, letters, spaces, words, sentences, and ch. In Part 3, the state variables I used were text_raw, text, shift, shift_norm, mode, alphabet, shifted, encrypt_map, decrypt_map, active_map, result, and ch.\n",

    "2- In Part 1A, the transition rule I relied on most was that leading_spaces decreases by 1 and inner_spaces increases by 2 as row increases in the top half. In Part 1B, the transition rule I relied on most was dist = abs(mid - row), because it automatically controls how leading_spaces and inner_spaces change above and below the midpoint. In Part 2, the transition rule I relied on most was scanning each character and incrementing letters only for A–Z/a–z and sentences only for periods, commas, exclamation marks etc. In part 3, the transition rule I relied on most was building the shifted alphabet by rotating alphabet by shift_norm and then using the correct dictionary map for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-In Part 1A, the invariant that helped me debug was that the first * must appear after exactly leading_spaces spaces on every row. In Part 1B, the invariant that helped me debug was that rows the same distance from the midpoint must print the same pattern, which guarantees symmetry. In Part 2, the invariant that helped me debug was that words should equal spaces + 1 under the single-space assumption. In Part 3, the invariant that helped me debug was that non-letter characters must stay unchanged and in the same position in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-One place a small bug would violate an invariant is in Part 1B if I used dist = mid - row instead of abs(mid - row). That would make leading_spaces negative after the midpoint, breaking the bounds invariant and the diamond would become misaligned or crash when multiplying spaces. I would notice because the output would no longer be symmetric and the bottom half would not mirror the top half.\n"
